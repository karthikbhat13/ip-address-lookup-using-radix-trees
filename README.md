# ip-address-lookup-using-radix-trees
This project was implemented to demonstrate the use of radix trees in the forward and reverse lookup of domain names and their ip addresses.
The radix tree is implemeted in c.
The code takes a list of the top 500 websites and their ip addresses.
The ip addresses are found using a bash script and written into a file along with their domain names separated by commas.
